There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  Pilot's Logbook (Name TBD)

## Sub-Heading ##
  Standard Pilots logbook and landing page with flight details and current information

## Summary ##
 A one stop landing page that serves as a quick reference for basic flight information.  Pilots will be able to see a record of their flights, total hours, and other information such as current weather and flight updates.

## Problem ##
  Pilots have many virtual tools at their disposal to access the information they need.  However, these applications can be overwhelming and have unfriendly UI.  Especially for new pilot's, navigating the well of digital resources can be daunting and the type of information pilots need varies.

## Solution ##
  With 'TBD', pilots of all skil levels will be able to access their most recent flight information from past flights including hour totals and types of aircraft they have flown.  Also, they will be able to see up to date weather and local airport anouncements all in one place.

## Quote from You ##
  'In the words of El Matador, you gotta take it to the limit, one more time!'

## How to Get Started ##
   * open the terminal console and navigate to the root directory of the app.
   * type in the following command to start the server and initaite the app "npm run dev"
   * A new tab should open in your browser displaying the web application

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
